        I am currently a student at the University of Alberta, in the Department of Computing Science. The title of
        my program is <a id="program" href="https://calendar.ualberta.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=6&poid=2723">Computing Science Specialization in Software Practice</a>,
        so have a look if you're interested in seeing all that is entailed with the program. I was accepted into the program for the 2016/2017 school year, so that is the
        program outline that I am following, and is what will be used to determine my eligibility to graduate. I actually started my university career in Psychology, so I
        spent a couple of years pursuing a degree in that field. However, towrds the end of my second year, I realised that I was no longer interested in Psychology as a
        final career goal, so I determined to make the change. I had taken a logic course as one of my options, and really enjoyed it, so my mother (who had taken some
        computing science courses when she was at university) recommended I try taking a course in Computing Science. I did so in the spring semester of 2015, and I loved it.
        So, I applied to the Faculty of Science, and was accepted for the following year. The field is still fascinating to me, and I enjoy the work that I am doing, so I am very
        happy that I made the decision to switch programs.

        Specifically within Computing Science, I am very interested in database design and implementation. Likewise, I am also interested in Data Analytics, and actually did
        an eight month internship with Employment and Social Development Canada working in that area. I thoroughly enjoyed that kind of work, and this experience has given me 
        the opportunity to not only improve my skills in SQL (Structured Query Language) and PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language; a procedural extension to SQL), 
        it also allowed me to get familiar with working with Oracle databases. I had the opportunity to develop my own PL/SQL package (a collection of related PL/SQL procedures), 
        and was able to do work that had a meaningful impact on the lives of Canadian citizens. I am very thankful for the opportunity I was given to work there. I am also interested 
        in cyber security, and would like to look more into the topic of software quality, and how addressing this can reduce vulnerability to attack. As well, I have recently
        developed an interest in web development.

        In terms of specific skills, I have had the opportunity gain exposure to a variety of different programming languages. Included in these is Python 3 (and some experience in Python 2),
        C, MIPS Assembly, SQL, PL/SQL and Java. Because of the base that I have gained in these languages, I will quickly be able to learn the syntax and details of any programming language
        that is required of me. In addition to these languages, I also have experience working with HTML and CSS (and I hope to add JavaScript and PHP to that list shortly). I also have skills 
        working with databases, and in a Data Analytics Services environment. Have a look at my resume (linked above) to get a better overview of my skills and experience!
