                Welcome! This is the website for Patrick A. Tamm. 
                I am currently a University of Alberta student, studying Computing Science, with a specialization in Software Practice. 
                I designed this website to give people a better impression of who I am, what my interests are and what I hope to provide potential employers. 
                Above you will find links to pages that talk a little bit about me, as well as links to pages that focus specifically on my field of study. 
                I am also beginning to work a little bit with web development, so this website is also a forum for me to practice and play with website design. 
                Check back often to see the modifications!
        </p>
