                I was born in Germany and lived there for roughly six-and-a-half years, 
                alternating between Canada and Germany. While I was very young when we 
                left, I can still fondly remember my time there. Particularly, I remember 
                the outdoors; I find the German country side very beautiful, and the time 
                I spent outside as a child - whether that was running around in the field, 
                walking through the woods with my friends, or going hiking up the mountain 
                with my dad - really instilled in me an appreciation for the outdoors. 
                When I was about six-and-a-half years old, my parents made the decision 
                to move us back to Canada, so that we could be closer to family. 
                After a brief stay with my grandparents while we were getting our footing 
                here in Canada, we made the move to Calgary. Staying there for close to 4 
                years, we decided to relocate again. This time, we moved to Edmonton, which 
                is where we've been ever since. After the amount of time I've spent in 
                Edmonton, this city has become home for me, but thanks to our frequent moves, 
                I have been able to get used to the process. Major changes in my environment 
                were not uncommon for me as I was growing up - I went to three different 
                elementary schools over the course of my elementary education, for example - 
                and because of this, as well as the frequent moves, I have gained the ability 
                to acclimatize to changing circumstances very quickly. So, while it might not 
                have been the most enjoyable experience at the time, as I reflect on those experiences, 
                I am grateful for them.
